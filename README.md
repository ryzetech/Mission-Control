# Mission-Control
## THIS CODEBASE HAS BEEN ARCHIVED!
### A handmade bot for FoxesInBoxes
#### What does it do?
This bot provides games and useful information to the FIB Discord server. It provides developer utility, economy and news around computers and spaceflight.

#### Currently planned:
 - [ ] FIB Service integration
 - [ ] age verification system
 - [x] NASA API access
 - [ ] Channel purging
 - [ ] proper command handling

#### Why does the code look so messy?
This project expanded so quickly from a Node.js practice to a full-scale bot that we didn't have time to create a proper handler for commands. Additionally, we aren't experts on what we do, we are just messing around and create something together because it's fun.

#### How can I collaborate?
Just open a new branch with the following title format:

    {features|fixes}/{your-name}/{title}
We  will look into it as fast as possible. If you have ideas but you can't code, join the Discord and tell us. We will be happy to work out a solution.
