# Mission-Control
### A handmade bot for FoxInTheBox
**What does it do?**
This bot provides games and useful information to the FITB Discord server. It provides developer utility, economy and news around computers and spaceflight.

**Currently planned:**
 - [ ] FitB Service integration
 - [ ] age verification system
 - [ ] NASA API access
 - [ ] Channel purging
 - [ ] proper command handling

**Why does the code look so messy?**
This project expanded so quickly from a Node.js practice to a full-scale bot that we didn't have time to create a proper handler for commands. Additionally, we aren't experts on what we do, we are just messing around and create something together because it's fun.

**How can I collaborate?**
Just open a new branch with the following title format:

    {features|fixes}/{your-name}/{title}
We  will look into it as fast as possible. If you have ideas but you can't code, join the Discord and tell us. We will be happy to work out a solution.

**How can I support the project and FoxInTheBox in general?**
